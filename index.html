			<p> Mathematicians have always been known for their extreme attention to detail and with good cause: It only takes one counter example to disprove a theorem. But by the same token, it only takes one bug for an angry client to call you in the middle of the night. Sometimes there's no other way around it, you just gotta sit down and get dirty, double check all your edge-cases and test everything you can (hopefully you're automating that!)</p>
	
			<p> Physicists on the other hand, have learned that good enough is often the best you can do. Nature is extremely complex and only the simplest problems have exact answers. They are masters of the approximation, and by focusing on the essence of the problem they'll give you an answer you can write on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back-of-the-envelope_calculation">back of an envelope</a>. At the end of the day, whether you're on a tight deadline or you just need to do more with less, physicists are some of the best problem solvers.</p>

				<p>My name is Daniel Tufcea and I am a <span id="my_age"></span> years old graduate trying to become the best version of himself. I believe in continually learning new things and working on your weaknesses as a path to self-improvement. </p>
			
				<p>I aspire to be a developer, master new technologies and build cool stuff. I have experience with MATLAB, Python, Java and a little bit of C++. I am currently learning web development: HTML5, CSS3, Javascript (jQuery, AnglularJS), mySQL, PHP. In the future, I plan to try out some graphics and game development through <a href="http://peerjs.com">PeerJs</a>, <a href="http://threejs.org">ThreeJS</a> and <a href="http://paperjs.org">PaperJS</a>. I have heard good things about and plan to check out Ruby on Rails and Django. </p>

				Background and education

        <div id="collapseTwo" class="panel-collapse collapse">
            <div class="panel-body">
                <p>I am a first generation immigrant from Romania and have lived most of my life in Montreal, Canada. As a result of my multicultural background, I fluently speak English, French and Romanian. My parents, like many immigrants, took my education very seriously from a young age and did not spare a single penny. I received my French education at <a href="http://www.reginaassumpta.qc.ca">Coll√®ge Regina Assumpta</a>, one of the highest rated high schools in Montreal. Under the Quebecois CEGEP system, I made the switch to English at <a href="http://www.marianopolis.edu">Marianopolis College</a>, an institution whose goal is to prepare students for university. </p>
			
				<p>With the goal of academic professorship in mind, I then went on to obtain a joint bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Physics and a master's of science from the prestigious <a href="http://www.mcgill.ca">McGill University</a>. Although I am still a big proponent of the scientific method, I have decided against an academic career due to the current situation and the associated opportunity cost. </p>
			
				<p>While for most of my education I have attended private institutions, I wholly support an affordable and accessible education to all. Without student loans and the scholarships sponsored by generous donors, I would not have been able to support myself. I look forward to paying it forward!  </p>

        <div id="collapseThree" class="panel-collapse collapse">
            <div class="panel-body">
                <p>I love science and discoveries. I think that, ideally and in the grand scheme of things, every problem is worth thinking about and every answer is worth seeking. I am interested in new technologies and am amazed by what we have achieved so far. Learning new things and solving problems (<a href="https://open.kattis.com">Kattis</a>, <a href="https://projecteuler.net">Project Euler</a>) is something I hope I'll never get tired off. </p>
			
				<p>I'm interested in computer science, in particular encryption and artificial intelligence. I believe those areas will be pivotal to the future of mankind. Encryption is ubiquitous in the digital era, it protects our privacy, authenticates us and it will even play an important role in the future of money (<a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/">Bitcoin</a>). Artificial intelligence is an inevitable field of study as we build evermore complex machines and programs. The ideas are wild (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_Autonomous_Organization">Decentralized Autonomous Organizations</a>) and the repercussion even wilder!</p>
			
				<p> I also support open source because, as a scientist, I value the gathering and sharing of knowledge. I believe that sharing and reviewing code as well as giving and receiving feedback is the best way to learn and progress in the long run, both as a society and as an individual. There is no need to reinvent the wheel when we stand on the shoulders of giants.</p>
			
				<p>There is an unfortunate social need to associate a face to the success of great projects, whereby we only acknowledge the giants of science or glorify the CEO as the man behind the company. However, there are often dozens, hundreds or even thousands of people working in collaboration, each bringing their own expertise without which projects and advancements could never see life. I am thankful for their work and I hope my contributions will shape the future of mankind in their own ways.</p>

                <p> In my spare time, I try to stay active as much as possible. In the summer, hiking and biking are my main activities; I take full advantage of <a href="http://www.routeverte.com/rv/">La Route verte</a> which offers over 150km of scenic bike lanes along Montreal's shores. In the colder months, it's me versus the weights as I try to best my personal records in the squat, bench, deadlift, overhead press and pull up. </p>
			
				<p> To supplement my fitness regimen and blow off some steam, I practice the French martial art <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savate"> Savate</a>, a form of kickboxing where the fighter wears shoes, from which it derives its name. I hope to one day try Muay Thai and Brazilian jiu-jitsu to broaden my horizons. </p>
			
				<p>  When I'm not working or training, I enjoy playing <a href="http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/">Dwarf Fortress</a> (<a href="http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Utility:Lazy_Newb_Pack">Lazy Newb Pack</a> to get started), where the great depth of the game and the lack of graphics stimulate the imagination and make it immersive. When I feel more strategically inclined I play <a href="http://prismata.net">Prismata</a>, and for some casual fun I play <a href="http://us.battle.net/hearthstone/en/">Hearthstone</a> with great success. </p>
